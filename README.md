I wrote the main function, using Javafx to write a graphical interface, the button click event.In the function section, I mainly wrote open (), exit(),copy,paste,cut,time and date,about.I wrote a little bit in the print part, but there were some mistakes, and my companion helped to correct them. I am responsible for code quality analysis and report generation. Finally, I wrote the test section, but I ran into some difficulties and did not solve them.
